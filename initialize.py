They were to be the ancestors of all the clans of the Inca people. Ayar Manco carried a magic staff made of the finest gold that would indicate the ideal place for Incas to live. After long travels, they reached Cusco where the staff sank into the ground. The people already living in Cusco fought hard to keep their land, but Mama Huaca was a fighter without a rival. When the people of Cusco attacked, she threw her bolas at a soldier killing him instantly. The other inhabitants, terrified, ran away. Finally the Incas settled in Cusco. After that, Ayar Manco became known as Manco Cápac, the founder of the Inca. It is said he and his sisters built the first Inca homes in the valley with their own hands. When it was time forhim to pass away, Manco Cápac instead turned to stone and a shrine was built around him. His son, Sinchi Roca, became the second emperor of the Inca. Sinchi Roca sacrificed humans on the steps of the shrine to honour his father. He used a special sword for this: it was called Nina Khillaychuki (“Fire Sword”) due to its orange hue.

A small part, sometimes even a single letter, will be enough to find the correct item, person, or location. Don''t worry, the game will ask you to be more specific when multiple objects with similar names are found.\n\nGreeting and speaking to people is essential for learning more information about certain topics and progressing in the game. Some people can be talked to multiple times and can even tell you new information about the same topic if talked to again. Talking to people may open up new dialogue options with the same, or some other person. There are some hidden locations that are not accessible until you have learned about them or about something that is there. Examine objects, people, and locations to discover previously hidden items and additional information. Special actions can be performed by using some objects and some things can be used in combination with other objects. Be mindful of your spending, you have a limited amount of money.\n\nThis game has a lot of text. Sometimes more than one full screen of text is shown at once. If you notice a large paragraph be sure to check above it as not to miss any potentially important text. All player input is prefixed with the \">\" symbol and any text shown because of that command is below that line up until the bottom of the console where there is another ''>'' symbol signifying that the game is waiting for input.\n\nIf you are unsure how to proceed try the \"help\" command or use the \"tips\" command to show this text again. Don''t forget the \"save\" and \"load\" commands! Use \"restart\" to begin the game again from the start.\n\nYou can lose the game.\n');")
