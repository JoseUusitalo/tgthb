DEVELOPER TIPS
--------------
The game has a robust text matching system. You are not required to type in the 
full names of objects. A small part, sometimes even a single letter, will be eno
ugh to find the correct item, person, or location. Don't worry, the game will as
k you to be more specific when multiple objects with similar names are found.

Greeting and speaking to people is essential for learning more information about
 certain topics and progressing in the game. Some people can be talked to multip
le times and can even tell you new information about the same topic if talked to
 again. Talking to people may open up new dialogue options with the same, or som
e other person. There are some hidden locations that are not accessible until yo
u have learned about them or about something that is there. Examine objects, peo
ple, and locations to discover previously hidden items and additional informatio
n. Special actions can be performed by using some objects and some things can be
 used in combination with other objects. Be mindful of your spending, you have a
 limited amount of money.

This game has a lot of text. Sometimes more than one full screen of text is show
n at once. If you notice a large paragraph be sure to check above it as not to m
iss any potentially important text. All player input is prefixed with the ">" sy
mbol and any text shown because of that command is below that line up until the 
bottom of the console where there is another '>' symbol signifying that the game
 is waiting for input.

If you are unsure how to proceed try the "help" command or use the "tips" comman
d to show this text again. Don't forget the "save" and "load" commands! Use "res
tart" to begin the game again from the start.

You can lose the game.

You are a Spanish archeology student studying at Museo de las Bellas Artes. The 
museum has just received a new artifact, a Bulgarian Dagger, and the museum dire
ctor Gorka Ibaiguren has asked you to take care of inspecting the dagger to dete

Storage Room 3
You are at the end of a fairly dark, dimly lit oblong room. The walls are covere
d in fragile 5th century Eastern European religious icons. The air is slightly c
ool and humid- just enough so to maintain the wooden icons from deteriorating. A
s you look around, you notice stands with glass boxes at the other end of the lo
ng space. Upon closer inspection, you discover they enclose ancient artefacts: a
 horse-shaped bronze medallion, a necklace made of dried-up grapes dipped in gol
d, several vases and a slightly curved iron dagger with a carved wooden handle.

Nobody is here and Bulgarian Dagger and Romanian Vase can be found in the area.

Director's Office
Gorka Ibaiguren's office depicts his two passions clearly and leaves no room for
 doubt about his love of surf and art. While his desk is always well organised a
nd professional, the walls reflect another side of his personality. The vigorous
 middle-aged man has attached a turquoise and yellow surfboard on the wall, righ
t next to a large poster of Sopelana beach. On the other side of his bureau resi
des an even more substantial world map, with small photographs of artefacts pinn
ed upon the locations they are from.

The director is surprised and raises his dark eyebrows. "You found that inside t
he Bulgarian Dagger? Fascinating! Let me inspect it more closely."

"Have you read this? This is incredible:"
Dear friend,
I apologise for not contacting you earlier; my travels have left me little time 
to indulge in such activities. That is why I am thinking of settling down in a m
onastery in Burgas and leading a quiet life, away from the stress of Sofia. I en
countered the Fjǫrsteinn on my last adventure, and with it I will be able to liv
e long enough to truly find myself. I hope this message finds you well and healt
hy. Hoping to have the pleasure of your visit soon,
your fellow chess enthusiast Zlatin Panayotov

P.S. Have you read my book on Erik the Red? I would like it if you sent me your 
thoughts about it later.

> TALK TO GORKA IBAIGUREN ABOUT LETTER

Gorka's face lights up and he looks at you with an astonished expression. "How e
xciting! You have to go find Mr. Panayotov and ask him to lend us the gem so we 
can inspect it. This is an invaluable opportunity to learn about Viking history 
and, who knows, maybe even the presence of supernatural beings! The museum will 
finance your travels. Here's 4125 money!"

Intern Office
You have now entered your small office. To your right is your working station, a
 rather small wooden desk with piles of archeology and history books. The rest o
f the room's decor is sparse: the picturesque book shelf on the left contains no
 more than 30 volumes and all your archeology equipment is contained within a sm
all box on the floor, next to the shelf. In an attempt to make the office more c
osy, you have pinned a movie poster to the wall, between the shelf and the table
. It used to read “Rocky Balboa”, but since you are a funny fellow, it now says 
“Rocky Bilbao.”

Bilbao Airport
The Bilbao Airport is, you find, rather small but quite beautiful. It is easily 
accessible by bus from the central Plaza Moyua. The crisp white roof is inclined
 and rounded, which gives you the impression of being inside a vast seashell. Yo
u walk slowly towards the gates, taking in the exquisite architecture. Since the
 airport is quite calm, you are able to pass through the security check without 
fuss. The indications are clear, and finding the right gate poses no problems: y

> TALK TO GEORGI BORISOV ABOUT ELEUSA MONASTERY

You walk to the cab and the driver opens the window. He looks at you from the fr
ont seat. His wide smile reveals a row of dark, stained teeth. "To Eleusa Monast
ery? Right away." He turns the key in the ignition and the car coughs loudly. "D
id you know "Eleusa" comes from Byzantine Greek and means "the Tender?" It's pro
bably not that interesting to you though, I'll concentrate on driving again." Ge
orgi faces the road and the car jumps forward.

> EXAMINE
You look around the rooms in the monastery but can't seem to find a anything of 
particular importance anywhere. You return back to where you started and notice 
a Martenitsa made from red and white string on the floor. A mere few meters away
 from where you originally stood. "Perhaps I should have started searching in th
is room first rather than going to through the entire monastery." you think to y
ourself.

> TAKE MARTENITSA
Martenitsa taken.

Martenitsa given to Monica.

The old woman smiles crookedly and her small, watery eyes twinkle in the sunligh
t. "Oh, that is so very nice of you, thank you sweety. My name is Monica. You lo
ok lost, my child, can I help you?"
> TALK TO MONICA ABOUT ZLATIN PANAYOTOV

"Zlatin Panayotov? Yes, I have known him. He was already an old man when I was a
 child. I would see him by the monastery steps every evening on my way home from
 our family shop. He would always nod, smile and wave calmly. Sometimes my mothe
r would let me go play chess with him in Eleusa. He was an avid player, and I le
arned many tactics from him. About twenty years ago he disappeared. I've heard r
umours that he went to Tibet to become a monk, but I don't believe them- he was 
so old he could not possibly have managed to go so far."

> TALK TO ZLATIN PANAYOTOV ABOUT FJÖRSTEINN

Zlatin's hand moves with surprising swiftness as he takes the gem out of his poc
ket. "The Fjǫrsteinn. The very same gem spoken of in the myths of the Vikings." 
He holds up the small emerald stone in front of your eyes. "Quite beautiful, is 
it not?" His eyes reflect the rock's faint green light and, for a moment, you ar
e reminded of your childhood neighbour's green-eyed cat. "I found this in Greenl
and nearly a century years ago. At the time, I was travelling the north, looking
 for Viking artefacts. One time in Norway I came across an interesting myth that
 described a powerful sword that belonged to Hveðrungr, nowadays more commonly k
nown as Loki. Have you heard about this?" (Y/N)
> YES

"Good. Now, as you know, the gem was never found- not until I did, anyway. The s
word, on the other hand, was found, but it disappeared from Norse mythology arou
nd 1020. Well, I happen to know the second part of the story. Guðhjǫrr reappeare
d as the weapon of a previously unknown viking called Hrosskell Hergeirsson near
ly 150 years later. Some say Leifr made sure he was buried with the sword, and n
o one dared disgrace his grave - until Hrosskell came along. The fabled viking w
as ruthless and unscrupulous. Even though Vikings were viewed as bloodthirsty an
d barbaric, he stood out from his kind. The man knew no limits to his quest for 
glory and power. He had to own the sword, had to have the most beautiful wives, 
had to go where no man had ever been before." The old man stops to take a sip of
 water.
"Not many are aware of this turn of events. I could have sought the blade, but I
 did not. Immortality comes with a price. It would have turned me into a monstru
osity over the years- a human figure void of humanity. I was content with the lo
ng, calm life the Fjǫrsteinn would provide me with, so I came here, to the solit
ude of these mountains. Now I have lived for 142 years and I feel ready to pass 
the gem on. Should I find a suitable person to pass it on."
> TALK TO ZLATIN PANAYOTOV ABOUT FJÖRSTEINN

Zlatin examines you attentively. "You seem to be a wise youngster. I will give y
ou the stone but I would like to ask you for something in return- consider this 
my dying wish, if you will. On one of my trips, to Tanzania this time, I lost a 
dear friend of mine. A small, fluffy vervet monkey. His name was Beast. I was tr
aveling in the region around Lake Natron at the time. Oh how I wish to see him a

traight through the town and into the wilderness. It's not too far."

 Another sip. "It is said to be haunted by the crew members that drowned with it
 nearly a thousand years ago." The Lone Patron stops talking and looks at his em

Edge of the Crater
You see an eroded depression in front of you, overgrown with a forest. The crate
r is just barely deep enough that you can't see the top of the trees from beyond
 the edge. A small river trickles down from the edge to a lake at the bottom.

Jakobshavn
The town is settled near the shore as the snow covered ground begins to rise ste
eply behind the furthest buildings. There is a single tall spiky rock standing o
n a smooth hill overlooking the town. The brightly colored wooden houses stand o
ut in the snow like snow-capped flowers. The loosely defined streets are distinc
tly empty apart from a couple of people going about their day.

Jens' Home
The living room of the private collector is fairly well furnished with artefacts
 ranging from expensive looking mats to ancient paintings. An unexpected sight i
n a rural town like Jakobshavn. There are several old weapons, jewelry items, an
d utensils spread about the room, some under dusty glass boxes. He even has a so
mewhat rotten plank hung on one wall. Being familiar with private collectors Jen
s doesn't appear to break the mold.

Port of Jakobshavn
The small and quiet little port is located on the coast of Disko Bay. The water 
is strikingly cyan in color. Several sheets of thick ice float in the still bay.
 You can see an island to the west. A loose group of wooden houses and shacks po
pulate the general area around the three wharves. Some buildings' smoke stacks p
uff light smoke in the air. You see a fisherman gutting cod outside his shack an
d another fixing a hole in his net. There is a row of hides drying in a long can
opy with several bulging leather sacks piled up at one end. A cold breeze catche
s you off guard, you shiver and pull up your collar more.

"Yes, I can take you to the bay area- for the small price of 70."

Melville Bay
The water is a pleasant deep blue but you shiver at the thought of swimming in i
t. The wide open bay area offers no protection from the biting wind. You notice 
a sailboat in the distance towards the north along with some houses on the shore
. You wonder about the name of the village.

"The story of the Guðhjǫrr is tied to one Hrosskell Hergeirsson. Being the fearl
ess warrior he was, he set course for Vinland in the footprints Leifr Eiríksson 
bringing the Guðhjǫrr with him. This, however, did not attenuate his thirst for 
prestige. He had to continue. Conquer new lands. New people. He travelled south 
at a fast pace, crossing the massive tundras with no difficulty. In fact, facing
 the snow and extreme cold of Vinland was no feat for the unrelenting Viking. Bu
t he pushed further south than any Vikingr before. The journey became more arduo
us as the temperatures rose, since we are not accustomed to such warm climates. 
Some of his men decided to settle down. Some died. Some ran. Not letting this st
op him, Hrosskell continued expanding further with only a small group of remaini
ng men. This is all I have gathered. I know not what has become of him." He turn
s his back and fades away before you can ask any more questions.

Port Master's Building
The port master supervises her port from the warmth of her tiny office most days
. The room is much smaller than it looks from the outside due to the copious num
ber of drawers covering the walls. There is an old leather and brass diving suit
 on display in one corner. The stacks of papers on her desk are just about to fa
ll over making you wonder how it's possible a tiny port like this would require 
so much management and paperwork.

A surprisingly young woman waves at you from a distance. "Hi!" she yells. You ar
e at a speaking distance from her in no time. "Let's go sit down and have some c
offee while we talk." You follow her to a picturesque coffee shop at the end of 
the street and sit down at a table so small your knees cannot fit underneath it.
 You opt to sit sideways with your right elbow on the table. Wayna follows your 
lead. "So, what exactly brings you here?"

Wayna grins. "Why yes, I do know a little something about Vikings in South Ameri
ca. The legends talk of a hidden temple somewhere near the old city of Ayacucho.
 It is made of large stone blocks with dozens of little suns carved into each ro
ck. The altar in the middle of the temple is also carved with Inca symbols that 
depict the myth of Nina Khillaychuki, Manco Cápac's firesword. Strange, is it no
t, that the myth describes the temple with such detail, yet no one has been able
 to find it."
You can talk to Wayna about Greet.

Ayacucho
This city seems quite arid when seen from the air. It is located in a crowded va

"Hidden temples? Hidden temples... Yeah, there might be one around here. Maybe. 
Not very popular with the tourists. Not like they'd know 'bout it. Or that there
 would be any tourists here. Ever. You are literally the first person I've seen 
around all day. This here place is dead. Dead I say. And to top it off you're no
t the ol' man from across the street, but a real tourist. In flesh and blood. Ri
ght there in fron' o' me. How on Earth did you EVER manage to get lost in this h
ere lil' village in the middle of exactly nowhere? Ah. Yes. Temples. Right abou'
 that-a-way just a ways away but not too far. I think. Be sure to bring a flashl
ight tho'. It's craaazy dark in there. Like pitch black. No light. Nil. Was ther
e once. Or twice. It makes no sense tho' since it's not like the cave openin' is
 that small. You should have plenny o' light down there but naaah. Of cooourse n
ot. That'd be too easy now wouldn't i'. Bu' hey atleast you can't really miss it
. It's kinda obvious the way that gaping black maw just seems to suck up light l
ike it's nobody's business. Weird, you know--" you quietly sneak away while the 
cook still rambles on...

The cave is very dark and vast. In the middle is an imposing altar.

Inca Ghost and Inca Skeleton Warrior are here and Altar and Sword of Erik the Re

These tools are certainly very useful but not on their own. You should consider 
using them on other items to inspect them with care.

> The sword slides in effortlessly into the hole in the altar. The harder you pu
sh the further the side of the altar opens. Once the sword is inside the slit up
 to it's hilt the side of altar is completely open revealing a sword inside. The
 replica sword is now firmly stuck inside the altar.

Guðhjǫrr taken.

                    ----    Chapter X: Engiandlátæv    ----

You have chosen to join the two into one. Perhaps unaware of the consequences. P
erhaps on purpose. For doing so your life will unchangeably be set upon a path o
f gods and treachery.

In a brilliant flash of light and an deafening hum the Fjǫrsteinn sets into the 
slot in the hilt of Guðhjǫrr the two becoming one.

You feel adrenaline rushing through your veins like never before and your heart 
feels like it's exploding. The sword is burning your hand, but you feel no pain.
 It's warmth like that of a furnace encompasses your entire being. The blade glo
ws as if it were on fire. For a moment you fear the metal might melt but you fai
l to form another thought as your mind goes blank. Your eyes go blind. Your head
 is filled with a voice louder than anything you have ever heard in your life.
