buairpor	Burgas Airport	0	The second largest airport in Bulgaria is not as impressive as it sounds. The previously white building is now a speckled gray color. Inside are rows of blue plastic chairs and impatient travelers.
buburgas	Burgas	1	Burgas is an old Thracian city located between the Dead Sea and the Burgas Lake. It is economically important because of the port- it is the main fishing site in Bulgaria.
bueleusa	Eleusa Monastery	1	This monastery dates from the 6th century. While it is mainly in ruins, some parts have been restored. One of its towers still stands and it can be visited. Monica lives here.
bumoback	Monastery Backyard	1	The overgrown backyard of the Zlatna Livada monastery is filled with the joyful screams of some children playing with a ball.
bumonast	Zlatna livada Monastery	1	This is the oldest monastery in Europe out in the middle of nowhere. It seems abandoned, but a few children can be seen playing in the backyard.
bumuseum	Archeological Museum	1	This museum exhibits the history of Nessebar since Thracian times.
bunesse	Nessebar	1	This small historical town of only thirty square kilometers is renowned for its untouched atmosphere: indeed, you will not see many tourists here.
grbay	Melville Bay	0	The water is a pleasant deep blue but you shiver at the thought of swimming in it. The wide open bay area offers no protection from the biting wind. You notice a sailboat in the distance towards the north along with some houses on the shore. You wonder about the name of the village.
grcralak	Crater Lake	1	The lake is a nearly perfect circle with dark and murky water that makes it difficult to judge its depth. The strangely warm water does not freeze during the dead of winter. It is surrounded by a forest. The large clearing around the lake is void of snow, probably due to the heat radiating from the body of water.
gredgecr	Edge of the Crater	1	You see an eroded depression in front of you, overgrown with a forest. The crater is just barely deep enough that you can’t see the top of the trees from beyond the edge. A small river trickles down from the edge to a lake at the bottom.
grfore	East Crater Forest	1	Some parts of the forest are dense making it difficult to move but you can see some clearings here and there. The snow on the trees gives them a candy-like look but the ground has stayed almost entirely clear of snow, even in the clearings.
grforn	North Crater Forest	1	The forest really thickens up here and moving takes quite a bit of effort. The snow on the trees gives them a candy-like look but the ground has stayed almost entirely clear of snow, even in the clearings. At least the birds sing their pretty little songs in the trees.
grforne	North-East Crater Forest	1	The forest isn’t very dense around these parts but strangely the ground is still mostly clear of snow.
grfornw	North-West Crater Forest	1	The forest isn’t very dense here so you catch a glimpse of a family of foxes walking around to the south. The snow on the trees gives them a candy-like look but the ground has stayed almost entirely clear of snow, even in the clearings.
grfors	South Crater Forest	1	The ground lacks the plentiful snow cover the few trees that are in the area have. You spot a white creature speeding past from the corner of your eye.
grforse	South-East Crater Forest	1	The forest really thickens up here and moving takes quite a bit of effort. The snow on the trees gives them a candy-like look but the ground has stayed almost entirely clear of snow, even in the clearings. At least the birds sing their pretty little songs in the trees.
grforsw	South-West Crater Forest	1	The snow on the trees gives them a candy-like look but the ground has stayed almost entirely clear of snow, even in the clearings.
grforw	West Crater Forest	1	The forest really thickens up here and moving takes quite a bit of effort. The snow on the trees gives them a candy-like look but the ground has stayed almost entirely clear of snow, even in the clearings. At least the birds sing their pretty little songs in the trees.
grinn1	Jakobshavn Inn	1	The smoky air stings as you breath in but warmth from the large fireplace quickly wraps around you making up for the smell. The inn isn’t exactly packed but taking into account the amount of people you’ve seen so far, nearly a fourth of the town must be here. A hushed buzz of conversation surrounds you along with the jingling of glasses and scraping of wood. Several people glance at you as you enter but don’t pay much attention, they’re probably used to the occasional merchant passing through. You make your way through the maze of tables to the counter where the innkeeper is talking with a patron.
grinn2	Jakobshavn Inn	1	The room is certainly warmer than outside but the lack of people in the room allow the warmth of the fire to quickly escape through the cracks. Cold is radiating from smooth but dirty stone floor. You see a lone patron drinking in the corner on the other side of a sea of tables. A few empty mugs are huddled together on one of the tables
grinnroo	Room	0	The little room is cozy, with a small night table with two drawers and a clean bed. You suppose it’s enough for the occasional traveler but a simple window could have been nice. Perhaps the innkeeper thinks the painting of the Jakobshavn port on the wall is an adequate replacement?
grjakob	Jakobshavn	1	The town is settled near the shore as the snow covered ground begins to rise steeply behind the furthest buildings. There is a single tall spiky rock standing on a smooth hill overlooking the town. The brightly colored wooden houses stand out in the snow like snow-capped flowers. The loosely defined streets are distinctly empty apart from a couple of people going about their day.
grjensho	Jens’ Home	0	The living room of the private collector is fairly well furnished with artefacts ranging from expensive looking mats to ancient paintings. An unexpected sight in a rural town like Jakobshavn. There are several old weapons, jewelry items, and utensils spread about the room, some under dusty glass boxes. He even has a somewhat rotten plank hung on one wall. Being familiar with private collectors Jens doesn’t appear to break the mold.
grlair1	Outside Shaman’s Lair	0	The nondescript bump in the ground that looks like any other mound. There is a small hole on the side, but it is hardly visible, even when you are staring right at it. There is a good chance you would never find it unless you were specifically looking for it.
grlair2	Shaman’s Lair	1	The large, cave-like structure is well hidden from the outside world. The walls have strange symbols carved into them and the pillar-like structures suggest the cave is not of natural origin.
grmaster	Port Master’s Building	1	The port master supervises her port from the warmth of her tiny office most days. The room is much smaller than it looks from the outside due to the copious number of drawers covering the walls. There is an old leather and brass diving suit on display in one corner. The stacks of papers on her desk are just about to fall over making you wonder how it’s possible a tiny port like this would require so much management and paperwork.
grport	Port of Jakobshavn	0	The small and quiet little port is located on the coast of Disko Bay. The water is strikingly cyan in color. Several sheets of thick ice float in the still bay. You can see an island to the west. A loose group of wooden houses and shacks populate the general area around the three wharves. Some buildings’ smoke stacks puff light smoke in the air. You see a fisherman gutting cod outside his shack and another fixing a hole in his net. There is a row of hides drying in a long canopy with several bulging leather sacks piled up at one end. A cold breeze catches you off guard, you shiver and pull up your collar more.
grpost	Jakobshavn Post Office	1	The first thing you notice as you enter the building is the slightly musty smell of the room and the moist air which makes you wonder why they haven’t insulated the room well enough since they handle so much paper. It is staggering how much post a little town like Jakobshavn can receive judging by the size of the room. One of the walls is covered with boxes stacked from floor to the ceiling with various markings on the side, probably describing the contents. There is simply no way all the boxes contain mere letters as there is a shelf with dozens of small boxes on another wall, some of which have letters and other documents in them. You walk towards a large messy table in the center of the room and notice two leather bags on a chair behind the table, once of which is open and filled with letters confirming your suspicions. The post office worker at the table looks at you inquiringly.
grship	Underwater Viking Ship	0	The sunken ship is that of the viking Kolbiorn. Rumours say the ghosts of the crew are still aboard.
grstore	General Store	1	The amount of various tools hung on the walls give an appearance of a more hunting oriented store but surprisingly enough they sell food as well. You don’t particularly like the appearance of the vegetables on one stand but you suppose they can’t do much better than that with the climate here.
inairpor	Bagdogra Airport	0	The airport has only one landing strip and one building. The gray building is not exactly a masterpiece of architecture.
inbussta	Bagdogra Bus Station	1	Bagdogra is located in the northeast of India, near the Nepalese border. Bagdogra has an airport and a train station.
inpost	Bagdogra Post Office	1	The Post office is located next to the train station because most of the mail comes to Bagdogra by train or by plane.
intrains	Bagdogra Train Station	1	The train station is located just north of the airport. It is a small building with only a few benches for the waiting passengers to sit on.
intrrest	Restaurant Carriage	1	The restaurant car has a small bar where the passengers can get their drinks and modest where they can dine.
intrro2	Room 2	1	This small room only has a bed and a table.
intrro7	Room 7	0	This small room only has a bed and a table.
intrsle1	Sleeping Carriage	1	The sleeping car has five small rooms for passengers. A narrow hallway goes through the car.
intrsle2	Sleeping Carriage II	1	The sleeping car has five small rooms for passengers. A narrow hallway goes through the car.
INV	INVENTORY	0	A WORKAROUND FOR ITEM/INVENTORY TABLE SEPARATION. THIS IS NOT TO BE USED AS A REAL LOCATION.
nehikesh	Hiking Supplies	1	The humble store sells hiking, fishing and hunting supplies.
nejaratr	Jarayotar Train Station	1	The unpretentious train station is the heart of the town.
nejaray	Jarayotar	1	Jarayotar is a popular stop for hikers traveling to the Himalayan mountain range.
netoti	Road to Tibet	1	This rural mountain road will take you to Tibet. There seems to be a small shack working as a bus station.
peairpor	Jorgé Chavez International Airport	0	This modern airport is covered in glass panes that reflect the sky’s blue color.
pearchiv	Archives	1	You have entered a very vast room with several long book shelves filled with ancient books and thesauruses.
pecave	Hidden Cave	0	The cave is very dark and vast. In the middle is an imposing altar.
pecave2	Hidden Cave	0	Like the cook said. It is absolutely pitch black here.
pecusco	Cusco	1	The center of Inca civilization has been home to all Inca emperors and the Sapa Inka before them.
peport	Port of Pisco	0	The space between the cranes and cargo boats is filled with small, colorful fishing barques.
pepost	Pisco Post Office	1	The post is located in an old colonial building, ten minutes by foot from the port. Oddly enough there is a black, dusty, telephone on the wall.
pevillag	Ayacucho	0	This city seems quite arid when seen from the air. It is located in a crowded valley with only a few green spots on the outskirts.
spairpor	Bilbao Airport	1	The Bilbao Airport is, you find, rather small but quite beautiful. It is easily accessible by bus from the central Plaza Moyua. The crisp white roof is inclined and rounded, which gives you the impression of being inside a vast seashell. You walk slowly towards the gates, taking in the exquisite architecture. Since the airport is quite calm, you are able to pass through the security check without fuss. The indications are clear, and finding the right gate poses no problems: you are now awaiting boarding.
sparchiv	Museum Archives	1	This just might be your favourite room in the museum. Books, books and more books. You inhale the air and feel welcomed by the smell of old paper and leather covers. The familiar scent invokes memories of long nights spent doing research at the university library. The archives are separated into three long columns of shelves, organised by date: B.C., 1-1000A.C. and 1001A.C-present.
spbilbao	Bilbao	1	This medium-sized city is half an hour from Sopelana beach. The Guggenheim and Bellas Artes museums are two of the main tourist attractions. The easiest way to travel within the city is by foot. Bilbao gives off a friendly, relaxed atmosphere: the river and numerous parks create a stress-relieving surrounding for city-dwellers.
spdiroff	Director’s Office	1	Gorka Ibaiguren’s office depicts his two passions clearly and leaves no room for doubt about his love of surf and art. While his desk is always well organised and professional, the walls reflect another side of his personality. The vigorous middle-aged man has attached a turquoise and yellow surfboard on the wall, right next to a large poster of Sopelana beach. On the other side of his bureau resides an even more substantial world map, with small photographs of artefacts pinned upon the locations they are from.
spintoff	Intern Office	1	You have now entered your small office. To your right is your working station, a rather small wooden desk with piles of archeology and history books. The rest of the room’s decor is sparse: the picturesque book shelf on the left contains no more than 30 volumes and all your archeology equipment is contained within a small box on the floor, next to the shelf. In an attempt to make the office more cosy, you have pinned a movie poster to the wall, between the shelf and the table. It used to read “Rocky Balboa”, but since you are a funny fellow, it now says “Rocky Bilbao.”
spmuseum	Museo de las Bellas Artes	1	This large museum was established in 1914 and has since accumulated an impressive range of artifacts (from Imperial Japan to modern Europe).
spport	Port of Bilbao	1	Industrial port near Sopelana beach.
sproom3	Storage Room 3	1	You are at the end of a fairly dark, dimly lit oblong room. The walls are covered in fragile 5th century Eastern European religious icons. The air is slightly cool and humid- just enough so to maintain the wooden icons from deteriorating. As you look around, you notice stands with glass boxes at the other end of the long space. Upon closer inspection, you discover they enclose ancient artefacts: a horse-shaped bronze medallion, a necklace made of dried-up grapes dipped in gold, several vases and a slightly curved iron dagger with a carved wooden handle.
stresste	Warp!	0	All locations filled!
taairpor	Tanga Airport	0	The airport is located just outside of Tanga and consists of only a few little buildings.

tipumqu3	Pum Qu III	1	The calm river flows north from Chentangzen.
tisakpor	Sakya Monastery Porch	1	The front porch of the largest Buddhist monastery in Tibet is, to say the least, ancient. Some rocks have fallen from the roof down unto the stairs, yet there is no doubt the robust porch will remain in place for centuries to come.
tisakya	Sakya Monastery	0	The Buddhist monastery on the top of the mountain accomodates nearly a hundred monks.
tishore	Shore of Pum Qu	1	The sandy shore of the river Pum Qu, next to the village of Chentangzhen, has no vegetation. There's a small boat on the beach.
titone	Road to Nepal	1	This rugged mountain road leads to Nepal.
titserom	Tsering’s Room	1	The room is humble, just like its inhabitant. There is only one chair, a thin but comfortable-looking mattress on the floor and an elementary chest.
