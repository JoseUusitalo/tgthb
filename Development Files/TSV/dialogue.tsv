georgi1	bugeorgi	Eleusa Monastery	You walk to the cab and the driver opens the window. He looks at you from the front seat. His wide smile reveals a row of dark, stained teeth. "To Eleusa Monastery? Right away." He turns the key in the ignition and the car coughs loudly. "Did you know "Eleusa" comes from Byzantine Greek and means "the Tender?" It's probably not that interesting to you though, I'll concentrate on driving again." Georgi faces the road and the car jumps forward.
georgi2	bugeorgi	\N	"Hello to you, too. We'll be there in no time."
georgree	bugeorgi	Greet	"Good day! Need a ride? It's 10 a ride, you won't find better prices anywhere else!"
mongreet	bumonica	Greet	"Oh, dear me, dear me. I seem to have lost my bracelet somewhere."
monica2	bumonica	\N	"Zlatin Panayotov? Yes, I have known him. He was already an old man when I was a child. I would see him by the monastery steps every evening on my way home from our family shop. He would always nod, smile and wave calmly. Sometimes my mother would let me go play chess with him in Eleusa. He was an avid player, and I learned many tactics from him. About twenty years ago he disappeared. I've heard rumours that he went to Tibet to become a monk, but I don't believe them- he was so old he could not possibly have managed to go so far."
monica3	bumonica	Zlatin Panayotov	The elderly lady seems to become even smaller as she tightens the shawl around her shoulders. "I don't know you- please leave me alone."
moniretu	bumonica	\N	The old woman smiles crookedly and her small, watery eyes twinkle in the sunlight. "Oh, that is so very nice of you, thank you sweety. My name is Monica. You look lost, my child, can I help you?"
grdedgre	grdead	Greet	All of a sudden, you hear a low voice resonating inside your brass helmet. You see the what appears to be a white humanoid light source fading into view a few meters in front of you. "Who goes there?"
grfish	grfisher	Vikings	"Vikings? I dunno 'bout 'em. There's that collector fella who might be able to help you though. That drunkard's at the inn all the time."
grfishgr	grfisher	Greet	"Travelers 'round these part are always either merchants or here fo' the crater. Like I said, not too far from here. Go on."
inngreet	grinnkee	Greet	"Good day young man. Here for a drink? Perhaps a roof over your head?"
innlone	grinnkee	\N	"He's here almost every night. Sticks to himself most of the time. Although he went home already, you might catch him tomorrow."
innroom1	grinnkee	\N	"We have a few vacant rooms. It'll cost you a 20 to rent one for the night."
innroom2	grinnkee	\N	"Back again are we? 20 a night, if you please."
jengreet	grjens	Greet	"Hello again."
jensalt	grjens	\N	"Too... expensive for you?" Jens smirks, "Well... should you come across a Viking artifact of equal value I might exchange the sword for that." he says. "Speaking of which... There have been rumors of strange goings-on at the crater amongst the villagers but then again they always have some fitting myth or story about that crater for every situation. It's probably nothing but I personally wouldn't risk my hide going there this time of year. Wolves are about."
jensgive	grjens	\N	"Incredible! Where did you find this? Here! Take the sword!"
jensty	grjens	\N	"Thanks."
jensword	grjens	Kolbiorn's Sword	"Kolbiorn's Sword? Hmmm... Yes, I do believe I have the sword of that particular viking. Where did you hear about it? Oh! Are you interested in buying it? I might part with for the modest sum of 1200. How's that sound? (Y/N)"
kolexch	grkolbio	\N	"The story of the Guðhjǫrr is tied to one Hrosskell Hergeirsson. Being the fearless warrior he was, he set course for Vinland in the footprints Leifr Eiríksson bringing the Guðhjǫrr with him. This, however, did not attenuate his thirst for prestige. He had to continue. Conquer new lands. New people. He travelled south at a fast pace, crossing the massive tundras with no difficulty. In fact, facing the snow and extreme cold of Vinland was no feat for the unrelenting Viking. But he pushed further south than any Vikingr before. The journey became more arduous as the temperatures rose, since we are not accustomed to such warm climates. Some of his men decided to settle down. Some died. Some ran. Not letting this stop him, Hrosskell continued expanding further with only a small group of remaining men. This is all I have gathered. I know not what has become of him." He turns his back and fades away before you can ask any more questions.
kolgreet	grkolbio	Greet	"You wake me from my slumber for pointless drivel?"
kolrule	grkolbio	Guthhjörr	"You wish to know of Guðhjǫrr?" Kolbiorn roars, "Oh perhaps I shall tell you what wish to know. But not for free, oh no. I require something in return for this information you seek. My sword... My precious sword has been stolen from me! How dare he! How dare that FILTHY PEASANT TOUCH MY PRECIOUS SWORD WITH HIS FILTHY PEASANT HANDS!" he blows up. "YOU!" Kolbiorn yells pointing at you "I DEMAND YOU BRING ME MY SWORD!"
kolthank	grkolbio	\N	"You have my gratitude." echoes in your head.
lonemor1	grlone	\N	"I might be able to tell you some more if you have another drink with me." he says.
lonemor2	grlone	\N	"I think I know a bit more about vikings that might interest you."
lonep1	grlone	\N	"Ah, mead, the sweet elixir of my life." He takes another large gulp. "Guðhjǫrr you say? That is a mythical sword that supposedly gives its beholder invincibility. It is an important part of Viking mythology." He finishes his mead in one gulp. "Oh, look at that, I'm already out of something to drink..."
lonep2	grlone	\N	"Much better, thank you." He drinks half of the mug at once. "You have come to the right place if you want to learn about Vikings." He sips. "Did you know there are a few renowned, mythical places around here? The sunken ship, for example." Another sip. "It is said to be haunted by the crew members that drowned with it nearly a thousand years ago." The Lone Patron stops talking and looks at his empty glass with great sorrow in his eyes.
lonep3	grlone	\N	He takes yet another sip. "There we go. As I was saying, the sunken ship is haunted- according to the legend, of course. The captain Kolbiorn and his men spend eternity in their death trap, forever recounting old Norse stories. Whether you choose to believe in that is up to you. Now, if you will excuse me, the bar counter is calling me."
lonesea1	grlone	\N	"Excellent! Thank you! Please have a seat friend!"
lonesea2	grlone	\N	"Thank you! Please have a seat friend!"
lonesea3	grlone	\N	"Please have a seat friend!"
longreet	grlone	Greet	"Mead?"
grmawork	grportma	\N	"Did the suit still work? I hope you enjoyed diving, here's your money back."
pmgreet	grportma	Greet	"What can I do for you?"
pmsuit	grportma	Diving Suit	She points at an old, rugged diving suit. The helm has several bumps and you wonder whether or not it is still waterproof. "That thing? It was my father's. He used to dive a lot when I was younger. I haven't personally used it in years but it should stil be waterproof. Are you interested in diving? Not many people are but I could rent you the suit for a 500 but please return it and don't damage it. It has sentimental value to me."
grpostgr	grpostw	Greet	"Yes, yes, welcome, what is it?"
grpostw	grpostw	\N	He silently points to the corner of the room.
grsail1	grsailor	Greet	"Hello, nice to see you."
grsail2	grsailor	\N	"Yes, I can take you to the bay area- for the small price of 70."
grsail3	grsailor	\N	"Right away, sir..."
grsailvi	grsailor	Artifacts	"Ah. You'll want that collector person who practically lives at the inn. He knows about all that ol' stuff, not me."
grstore	grstore	Greet	"Welcome, welcome! Feel free to look around! We have many interesting items, from beef jerky to sharpest axes!"
volgre	grvolur	Greet	She stares at you with a stoic face.
volneck	grvolur	Necklace	"I require the shed skin of a two-legged snake whose scales are as pale as untouched snow. For that only, I will exhange my necklace for."
inbusdri	inbusdri	Greet	"20 per ride please. Very cheap!"
inticket	intimast	Tickets	"80 one ticket. No ticket. No train. Want buy ticket?"
intickgr	intimast	Greet	"Much welcome! Nice day yes? Want train? I sell ticket!"
intiwelc	intimast	\N	"Welcome train!" the Ticket Master says.
neyetigr	neyeti	Greet	"UUUURRRrrrr"
deusexma	pecook	Hidden Temples	"Hidden temples? Hidden temples... Yeah, there might be one around here. Maybe. Not very popular with the tourists. Not like they'd know 'bout it. Or that there would be any tourists here. Ever. You are literally the first person I've seen around all day. This here place is dead. Dead I say. And to top it off you're not the ol' man from across the street, but a real tourist. In flesh and blood. Right there in fron' o' me. How on Earth did you EVER manage to get lost in this here lil' village in the middle of exactly nowhere? Ah. Yes. Temples. Right abou' that-a-way just a ways away but not too far. I think. Be sure to bring a flashlight tho'. It's craaazy dark in there. Like pitch black. No light. Nil. Was there once. Or twice. It makes no sense tho' since it's not like the cave openin' is that small. You should have plenny o' light down there but naaah. Of cooourse not. That'd be too easy now wouldn't i'. Bu' hey atleast you can't really miss it. It's kinda obvious the way that gaping black maw just seems to suck up light like it's nobody's business. Weird, you know--" you quietly sneak away while the cook still rambles on...
pecook1	pecook	Greet	The cook looks up from the anticuchos, a grilled meat skewer regional speciality. "Good afternoon!" he says looking shocked.
pecook2	pecook	\N	"The stories say the temple is north-west from here, in a large clearing in the middle of the forest. No one has ever found it though. There is a clearing but no evidence of any infrastructures..."
peghspo	peghost	Greet	"OooOOOooo I'm a spooky ghooOOooOOoost!"
waycall1	pewayna	\N	A friendly voice answers the phone after just three rings. "Hi! I expected your call, Gorka contacted me earlier today. If you leave Pisco now, you'll be in Cusco in four hours- I'll be waiting for you there."
waygre2	pewayna	\N	"Find what you were looking for?" she asks warmly.
waygreet	pewayna	Greet	A surprisingly young woman waves at you from a distance. "Hi!" she yells. You are at a speaking distance from her in no time. "Let's go sit down and have some coffee while we talk." You follow her to a picturesque coffee shop at the end of the street and sit down at a table so small your knees cannot fit underneath it. You opt to sit sideways with your right elbow on the table. Wayna follows your lead. "So, what exactly brings you here?"
waymyth	pewayna	\N	Wayna grins. "Why yes, I do know a little something about Vikings in South America. The legends talk of a hidden temple somewhere near the old city of Ayacucho. It is made of large stone blocks with dozens of little suns carved into each rock. The altar in the middle of the temple is also carved with Inca symbols that depict the myth of Nina Khillaychuki, Manco Cápac's firesword. Strange, is it not, that the myth describes the temple with such detail, yet no one has been able to find it."
self	player	Greet	I have better things to do than talk to myself at the moment.
gorcall	spgorka	\N	"In Peru? Goodness, how an Earth did you end up there? -- Vikings in South America? Interesting... You might want to do some research on the subject. I know a renowned historian who might help you out. Her name is Wayna. You should call her as soon as you can to set up a meeting in Cusco."
gorcall1	spgorka	\N	"Hi, good to hear from you. Did you find Mr. Panayotov?"
gorcall2	spgorka	\N	"That's alright, you will just have to follow the lead and travel to Tibet. I will send you some more money. Take care and call me if you need help. Until next time."
gorgreet	spgorka	Greet	Gorka looks up at you from his papers and smiles. "Hello, any progress with the dagger?"
gorgre2	spgorka	\N	"Have you found Mr. Panayotov yet?"
gorhelp	spgorka	Bulgarian Dagger	"Have you thoroughly inspected the dagger with your tools?" (Y/N)
gorhh2	spgorka	\N	"Ugh, you know this. You need to be more careful with these artifacts!" Gorka inspects the gap between the pommel and handle. "Hold on. This isn't damaged. The pommel has - is a screw." He screws open the handle.
gorhh3	spgorka	\N	"Then what is this?" he says while holding the dagger in front of your face, pointing at the small gap between the pommel and handle. "How come you didn't meantion this? It looks like the pommel might fall off if you not handled prope- wait a second. It's a screw." He screws the handle open.
grnodag	spgorka	\N	"Then would you mind fetching the dagger? I'd like to take a closer look at it."
gornotme	spgorka	\N	"You are supposed to inspect this artifact. Not me."
gorsigh	spgorka	\N	"Then would you please go to your office and inspect the artifact, please." he sighs.
gorhhold	spgorka	\N	"Okay, did you find anything of interest? Let me see the dagger." Gorka takes the dagger from you. "A fairly typical artifact of it's time. I believe we might have ano- but hold on. What is this?" He points at the pommel. "Did you damage the dagger?" (Y/N)
gorlet2	spgorka	\N	Gorka's face lights up and he looks at you with an astonished expression. "How exciting! You have to go find Mr. Panayotov and ask him to lend us the gem so we can inspect it. This is an invaluable opportunity to learn about Viking history and, who knows, maybe even the presence of supernatural beings! The museum will finance your travels. Here's 4125 money!"
gorsupr	spgorka	\N	The director is surprised and raises his dark eyebrows. "You found that inside the Bulgarian Dagger? Fascinating! Let me inspect it more closely."
gorwoah	spgorka	\N	"Have you read this? This is incredible:"
gorfjo	spgorka	\N	"Incredible! Magnificent! This gem is indeed most beautiful! It will be a fine addition to our collection! Just look at it! Look how it glows! Everyone must know about this! I will arrange for a reporter to come over as soon as possible. Everyone must hear of your travels. It had to very exciting was it not? And more publicity for us! Think of the tourists! The locals! The museum will be talk of the town for weeks! Maybe even months! Oh you need a raise right this instant, but first if you'll excuse me I need to make a few phone calls to paper, few colleagues... Did you happen to find anything else on your travels? (Y/N)"
gorrep	spgorka	\N	"Oh my! What a fine Viking sword you have there. But did you not go on your adventure to find a gem of some sort? Did you not find Mr. Panayotov? It matters not. More artifacts, the better. I'll give you the honors of inspecting the weapon and categorizing it, off you go. Lot's of work to do! Unless you found more artifacts? In which case you would even more work! (Y/N)"
gorgut	spgorka	\N	"What an incredible sword! It appears to be of Viking origin is it not? How is it so well preserved? It seems like it was forged yesterday. Where did you find this? Peru?! Viking artifacts in South America are very rare. Hmmm... Were there any more artifacts where you found this? Should we start excavating there? This could be expensive, but South American Viking artifacts... Such publicity... All the newspapers... My colleagues... Speaking of which, what of Mr. Panayotov and the gem? Did you find any other artifacts on your travels?" (Y/N)
gornec	spgorka	\N	"Interesting. Such a well preserved necklace. You found it in Greenland? Impressive, you must have been traveling the world a lot to end up there. Did you find anything else on your travels?" (Y/N)
gormore	spgorka	\N	"Ooh! How exciting! Show me!"
gordone	spgorka	\N	"Did you find any other artifacts?" (Y/N)
chief1	tachief	Zlatin Panayotov	"Zlatin? Zlatin! That idiot! He awoke the lake monster!"
chief2	tachief	\N	"Emela-ntouka is dead? You are most brave! Thank you! Hrrmmhh... Did Zlatin send you? Should have known it. Why else would strangers be coming here. Of course it had to be that damned Bulgarian! I know what you want. Take his blasted pet. It's ugly anyways."
chiefgre	tachief	Greet	"Who are you? What do you want?"
neema	taneema	Lake Natron	"I can show you the way, I'm familiar with the surroundings."
neema1	taneema	\N	"Airport? Follow me."
neemagre	taneema	Greet	"Hello hello! I am a tourist guide! Are interested in traveling the wilds? I can help you! I know these lands very well indeed."
tapopogr	tapopo	Greet	"popo poPO BAAWAAAA!"
fisher1	tifisher	Boat	"No use boat. Can't fish. Net broken. Go away. I busy."
tifithan	tifisher	\N	"Good many thanks. Need help? I have boat."
sakymogr	timonk1	Greet	The monk smiles warmly and nods.
sakymonk	timonk1	\N	"Zlatin? Panayotov? I do not recall hearing of a monk going by that name I'm afraid. Bulgarian you say? We certainly do not have many foreigners here and none of them are from Bulgaria. Sorry, the person must be in another monastery."
monk1	timonk2	Greet	The monk walks towards you at a calm, steady pace. "Help?" He smiles warmly.
monk2	timonk2	Zlatin Panayotov	The man nods. "An old Bulgarian monk? Ah, I believe you are looking for Tsering. He's in his room at the moment. Go on inside."
tiyetigr	tiyeti	Greet	"HHRRRRRRRR"
zlagem	tizlatin	Fjörsteinn	Zlatin's hand moves with surprising swiftness as he takes the gem out of his pocket. "The Fjǫrsteinn. The very same gem spoken of in the myths of the Vikings." He holds up the small emerald stone in front of your eyes. "Quite beautiful, is it not?" His eyes reflect the rock's faint green light and, for a moment, you are reminded of your childhood neighbour's green-eyed cat. "I found this in Greenland nearly a century years ago. At the time, I was travelling the north, looking for Viking artefacts. One time in Norway I came across an interesting myth that described a powerful sword that belonged to Hveðrungr, nowadays more commonly known as Loki. Have you heard about this?" (Y/N)
zlagreet	tizlatin	Greet	The old man regards you with an enigmatic smile. 'I expected this to happen eventually.' He waves you towards the only chair in the room. 'So, you are here for the gem, are you not?'
zlamyth	tizlatin	\N	"Good. Now, as you know, the gem was never found- not until I did, anyway. The sword, on the other hand, was found, but it disappeared from Norse mythology around 1020. Well, I happen to know the second part of the story. Guðhjǫrr reappeared as the weapon of a previously unknown viking called Hrosskell Hergeirsson nearly 150 years later. Some say Leifr made sure he was buried with the sword, and no one dared disgrace his grave - until Hrosskell came along. The fabled viking was ruthless and unscrupulous. Even though Vikings were viewed as bloodthirsty and barbaric, he stood out from his kind. The man knew no limits to his quest for glory and power. He had to own the sword, had to have the most beautiful wives, had to go where no man had ever been before." The old man stops to take a sip of water.\n"Not many are aware of this turn of events. I could have sought the blade, but I did not. Immortality comes with a price. It would have turned me into a monstruosity over the years- a human figure void of humanity. I was content with the long, calm life the Fjǫrsteinn would provide me with, so I came here, to the solitude of these mountains. Now I have lived for 142 years and I feel ready to pass the gem on. Should I find a suitable person to pass it on."
zlanmyth	tizlatin	\N	"You haven't? Fortunately, I still have a copy of the book, so you can read about it for yourself." He hands you a large brown leather-bound volume.
zlapet	tizlatin	\N	Zlatin examines you attentively. "You seem to be a wise youngster. I will give you the stone but I would like to ask you for something in return- consider this my dying wish, if you will. On one of my trips, to Tanzania this time, I lost a dear friend of mine. A small, fluffy vervet monkey. His name was Beast. I was traveling in the region around Lake Natron at the time. Oh how I wish to see him again..."
zlapet2	tizlatin	\N	The old man tears up as you give him the once so lively monkey. "Thank you." Without another word, he hands you the gem.
