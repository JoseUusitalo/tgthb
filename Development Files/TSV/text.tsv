archbleh	This object isn't particularly interesting.
archdagg	You inspect the dagger for a while and quickly notice a slit between the pommel and the handle. It almost seems like the dagger could be opened.
archfake	You inspect the sword all around with the help of your Archeological Tools and realize that it has been made using techniques and materials unknown to the Vikings. "This sword was not made by the Vikings! It is a replica!"
bookinca	Inca oral history mentions three caves as the origin of life: Tambo Tocco, Maras Tocco and Sutic Tocco. Out of Tambo Tocco stepped four brothers and sisters: Ayar Manco, Ayar Cachi, Ayar Auca, Ayar Uchu, Mama Ocllo, Mama Raua, Mama Huaca, and Mama Cora. They were to be the ancestors of all the clans of the Inca people. Ayar Manco carried a magic staff made of the finest gold that would indicate the ideal place for Incas to live. After long travels, they reached Cusco where the staff sank into the ground. The people already living in Cusco fought hard to keep their land, but Mama Huaca was a fighter without a rival. When the people of Cusco attacked, she threw her bolas at a soldier killing him instantly. The other inhabitants, terrified, ran away. Finally the Incas settled in Cusco. After that, Ayar Manco became known as Manco Cápac, the founder of the Inca. It is said he and his sisters built the first Inca homes in the valley with their own hands. When it was time forhim to pass away, Manco Cápac instead turned to stone and a shrine was built around him. His son, Sinchi Roca, became the second emperor of the Inca. Sinchi Roca sacrificed humans on the steps of the shrine to honour his father. He used a special sword for this: it was called Nina Khillaychuki (“Fire Sword”) due to its orange hue. When swung, it seemed as though the metal had just been heated in brazing coals.

devtips	DEVELOPER TIPS\n--------------\nThe game has a robust text matching system. You are not required to type in the full names of objects. A small part, sometimes even a single letter, will be enough to find the correct item, person, or location. Don't worry, the game will ask you to be more specific when multiple objects with similar names are found.\n\nGreeting and speaking to people is essential for learning more information about certain topics and progressing in the game. Some people can be talked to multiple times and can even tell you new information about the same topic if talked to again. Talking to people may open up new dialogue options with the same, or some other person. There are some hidden locations that are not accessible until you have learned about them or about something that is there. Examine objects, people, and locations to discover previously hidden items and additional information. Special actions can be performed by using some objects and some things can be used in combination with other objects. Be mindful of your spending, you have a limited amount of money.\n\nThis game has a lot of text. Sometimes more than one full screen of text is shown at once. If you notice a large paragraph be sure to check above it as not to miss any potentially important text. All player input is prefixed with the ">" symbol and any text shown because of that command is below that line up until the bottom of the console where there is another '>' symbol signifying that the game is waiting for input.\n\nIf you are unsure how to proceed try the "help" command or use the "tips" command to show this text again. Don't forget the "save" and "load" commands! Use "restart" to begin the game again from the start.\n\nYou can lose the game.\n

endkfjor	So, you have decided to follow Zlatin's example by keeping the Fjǫrsteinn to yourself? What will you do with it? Will you keep it a secret? Will you become a public figure, a healer? A figure in the shadows, a person appearing throughout the pages of history for much longer than any human should? The path ahead of you is full of open doors for your life is neverending.

immortal	You have chosen to join the two into one. Perhaps unaware of the consequences. Perhaps on purpose. For doing so your life will unchangeably be set upon a path of gods and treachery.\n\nIn a brilliant flash of light and an deafening hum the Fjǫrsteinn sets into the slot in the hilt of Guðhjǫrr the two becoming one.\n\nYou feel adrenaline rushing through your veins like never before and your heart feels like it's exploding. The sword is burning your hand, but you feel no pain. It's warmth like that of a furnace encompasses your entire being. The blade glows as if it were on fire. For a moment you fear the metal might melt but you fail to form another thought as your mind goes blank. Your eyes go blind. Your head is filled with a voice louder than anything you have ever heard in your life.
innuendo	The sword slides in effortlessly into the hole in the altar. The harder you push the further the side of the altar opens. Once the sword is inside the slit up to it's hilt the side of altar is completely open revealing a sword inside. The replica sword is now firmly stuck inside the altar.
intro	You are a Spanish archeology student studying at Museo de las Bellas Artes. The museum has just received a new artifact, a Bulgarian Dagger, and the museum director Gorka Ibaiguren has asked you to take care of inspecting the dagger to determine its age, origin and anything else of particular interest.
killrob1	Right as you rush through the door to hide in your room a deafening bang fills the carriage and a bullet hits your back. The robber is not yet satisfied yet and decides put a couple more bullets in your back while you're laying on the ground bleeding profusely from your mouth.
killrob2	The two other robbers react quickly and carefully deposit numerous bullets in the general area around your heart.
killrob3	The other robbers crash through the door, notice their friend dead on the floor, and fill you with lead remarkably quickly.
killskel	Right as you take the sword from the altar the skeleton leaps towards you with the rattle of bones echoing in the cave. It goes straight for your neck with it's disturbing sharp teeth and tears your throat out. The amount of blood outside your body is rapidly becoming greater than the amount of blood inside your body.
killvolu	Vǫlur let's out a bloodcurdling scream, thrusts her hands towards you and in a flash of light you can feel the blood start boiling in your veins. You fall to the floor from the searing hot pain and in your last seconds of consciousness you see flames from Vǫlur's eyes licking her face without harming her. Your consciousness fades...
kolpleas	The ghost looks at you disappointingly.
letter	Dear friend,\nI apologise for not contacting you earlier; my travels have left me little time to indulge in such activities. That is why I am thinking of settling down in a monastery in Burgas and leading a quiet life, away from the stress of Sofia. I encountered the Fjǫrsteinn on my last adventure, and with it I will be able to live long enough to truly find myself. I hope this message finds you well and healthy. Hoping to have the pleasure of your visit soon,\nyour fellow chess enthusiast Zlatin Panayotov\n\nP.S. Have you read my book on Erik the Red? I would like it if you sent me your thoughts about it later.
nophone	There's no answer.
peghhaha	The bullet passes through the ghost and it continues idly floating around being all spooky.
phonthin	"Huh, nobody's here." you think to yourself "Is that a phone? I wonder if I could call Gorka."
robburst	A robber bursts into the carriage right behind you. He yells something incomprehensible while aiming his gun at your chest.
robescap	You just barely manage to escape from the robbers. But you hear them running towards you in the other carriage.
robhide	You slip into the room and quickly lock the door behind you. You thank your luck, who knows what would have happened if the door was locked. You wait in the small dark room for a few minutes just to be sure. The train stops for a moment and continues moving soon after. The robbers must have left but you decide to wait around for an hour just to be sure.
robresta	As you enter the carriage some people in masks are waving guns around demanding people's valuables. One of them spots you and yells something in Hindi.
shiphere	This where the ship sunk according to the Lone Patron.
shipunde	The ship is underwater and I am not diving down there without proper gear.
skelboom	The impact of the bullet causes the skeleton to explode in a magnificent shower of bones.
sleepinn	You slept well. In the morning you descend down the stairs to the bar. The innkeeper is still behind the counter, you wonder if she sleeps at all. "If you're looking for Jens, the man you were asking about last night, you'll probably find him at his house a bit east from here." the innkeeper says to you.
tifiboat	The Fisherman takes you along the river with his little boat.
usearch	These tools are certainly very useful but not on their own. You should consider using them on other items to inspect them with care.
usedagg	You screw open the handle of the dagger and a tightly rolled letter falls out!
uselett	The letter appears to be written in Old Norse.
usesuit	"This should be useful for exploring that sunk viking ship."
vikbook	This paragraph from the book caught your eye.\n\nEiríkr hinn Rauði, known as Erik the Red in modern times, discovered a sword in the crater of a meteorite near Maniitsoq, Greenland, circa 1000. According to the folk story, the sword was Bálbrandr, Loki’s weapon that fell all the way to Earth during his fight with Thor. The god of thunder won and bound Loki, so the latter could not retrieve his sword. Bálbrandr consisted of two parts: a metal blade that made its beholder invincible and a gem that prolonged life. When the amulet was placed in the sword’s hilt, the owner became immortal. The sword and gem separated upon the weapon’s fall to Earth. The gem was never seen again, and the sword became known as Guðhjǫrr.\n Guðhjǫrr was passed onto Erik’ son, Leifr Eiríksson, the first European to set foot on continental North America. Leifr is believed to have died between the years 1019 and 1025- the conditions of his death are very unclear. During this time, the precious sword was lost and it disappeared from Norse mythology.
wolftrai	The wolves walk to the north and into the wilderness, leaving behind a trail in the snow.
